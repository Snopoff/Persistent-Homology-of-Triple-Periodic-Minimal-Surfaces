# Persistent-Homology-of-Triple-Periodic-Minimal-Surfaces
Models of triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) are among the most interesting types of porous structures. TPMS have great potential due to their structural efficiency achieved by minimizing the total surface area and rational distribution of mass (material).
Unlike traditional porous materials, modeling, designing, and manufacturing TPMS objects are most interesting, simple, and efficient from both applied and research perspectives.
The physical properties of such models primarily depend on the degree of porosity of the material. The selection of an optimal shape with the necessary volume of pores is solved at the stage of mathematical and computer modeling.
